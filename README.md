## Goals
Here at Mach1 we have encountered numerous amounts of pitfalls and learning curves while being creators, developers and consumers of spatial, multichannel and interactive audio projects and productions. We are striving to build better understanding to encourage best practices by sharing our experiences and knowledge and constructing tools that others can use or build on top of. Some of these tools have been collected into the following related repositories: 
 - https://github.com/Mach1Studios/m1-sdk
 - https://github.com/Mach1Studios/m1-admparser
 - https://github.com/Mach1Studios/m1-web-spatialaudioplayer

We also are hoping to encourage growth of nomenclature around these emerging new audio mediums and do so by collecting terms and phrases into a glossary that can show related linking to words to reduce confusion in the current audio creator and developer landscapes.

The ultimate goal of this blog and repository is to also get others to contribute to both the blog posts and glossary and let both become more community orientated.
