### [Spatial Audio](../general-terms#spatial-audio)

The term spatial audio has been thrown around a lot lately, especially as companies such as Apple tout it as a new feature – but *what is spatial audio*? What does it mean when you're listening to something with spatial audio? 

Spatial audio is a concept that has been used and defined in several ways. You could say that any audio expressed with more than one channel is spatial audio. The advent of stereo technology or surround sound systems can be considered spatial, but are not spatial audio as we define it today. You could also say that spatial audio is any kind of sound that interacts with space or spatial effects. We use spatial effects all the time in music. Reverberation, for example, is a spatial effect that represents the physical phenomenon of a sound wave bouncing off different materials in the real world, the way light bounces off a mirror. In a way, any sound that replicates the way we hear naturally in real life is spatial audio.

If we had to pick, then here are four main elements that could define spatial audio. Spatial audio tends to make use of sound [externalisation](../general-terms#externalisation), [direction](../general-terms#direction), [distance](../general-terms#distance), and [presence](../general-terms#presence).

### [Presence](../general-terms#presence)
Presence might be the most crucial aspect of spatial sound because it adds to our ability to be moved by the content we consume. Presence is also closely related to engagement, and connection to ourselves and others. Needless to say, it's a powerful energy that spatial sound can create. Presence is the feeling of '_being there'_.
