## Spatial Audio General Terms

### [Spatial Audio](#spatial-audio)

Spatial audio has been thrown a lot as a term lately, especially as companies such as Apple tout it as a new feature – but what is spatial audio? What does it mean when you're listening to something with spatial audio? 

Spatial audio is a concept that has been defined in several ways. When you think of audio in terms of channels, you could say that any audio containing more than one channel is spatial audio (think of the advent of stereo technology, or surround sound systems). You could also approach spatial audio as any kind of sound that either plays with space or spatial effects. We use spatial effects all the time in music. Reverberation, for example,is a spatial effect that represents the physical phenomenon of a sound wave bouncing off different materials in the real world, the way light bounces off a mirror. In a way, any sound that replicates the way we hear naturally, in real life, is spatial audio.

But if we had to pick, then here are four main elements that could define spatial audio. Spatial audio tends to make use of sound [externalisation](externalisation), [direction](direction), [distance](distance), and [presence](presence).

### [Presence](#presence)

_Presence might be the most crucial aspect of spatial sound because it adds to our ability to be moved by the content we consume. Presence is also closely related to engagement, and connection to ourselves and others. Needless to say, it's a powerful energy that spatial sound can create. Presence is the feeling of '_being there'.__
