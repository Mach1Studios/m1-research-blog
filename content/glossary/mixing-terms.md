### [Panning](../mixing-terms#panning)
_Refers to panning a source sound or track into a spatial soundfield multichannel configuration or format. It is completely synonymous with [Encode](../technical-terms#encode)_
##### Synonyms : [Pan](../mixing-terms#panning), [Encode](../technical-terms#encode), Input to Spatial Soundfield
##### Related Terms :

### [Monitoring](../mixing-terms#monitoring)
_Refers to the binaural downmix based on the current listening "orientation" as a method of monitoring or live listening to a spatial soundfield via stereo binuaralized headpones or speakers. It is completely synonymous with [Decode](../technical-terms#decode)_
##### Synonyms : [Monitor](../mixing-terms#monitoring), [Decode](../technical-terms#decode), [Listening](../mixing-terms#monitoring), Stereo Playback, [Binauralized](../mixing-terms#binaural)
##### Related Terms : [Binaural](../mixing-terms#binaural)

---

### [Divergence](../mixing-terms#diverge)
_Divergence describes the amount of concentration of a panned or encoded input sound source to a specific [azimuth](../technical-terms#azimuth) or [elevation](../technical-terms#elevation). For example the higher the diverge the less this signal will exist in the opposite direction, the lower the diverge the more the signal will exist in all directions (until eventually becoming mono during [monitoring](../mixing-terms#monitoring) or [decoding](../technical-terms#decode))._
_This is unique to a vector based spatial or multichannel audio system and is different from sperhical based audio systems [distance](../general-terms#distance) which is less about signal distribution within a soundfield._
##### Synonyms : Focus, Directional Isolation
##### Related Terms : [Distance](../general-terms#distance)

### [HRTF](../mixing-terms#hrtf)
##### Synonyms : [Head Related Transfer Functions](../general-terms#hrtf)
##### Related Terms : 

---

### [Room Modeling](../mixing-terms#room-modeling)
_Room modeling is a catch all term for various [reverberance](../mixing-terms#reverb), delay and even filter digital signal processes (DSP) that can be applied to the audio content. This can be used as a tool to add more externalization preception ability to any audio content but comes at the cost of altering the signal to do so. This effect is highly dependent on the use case and how this is being utilized to be more effective than destructive._
##### Synonyms : [Reverb](../mixing-terms#reverb), [Reverberance](../mixing-terms#reverb)
##### Related Terms : [Externalization](../general-terms#externalization)

### [Binaural Filtering](../mixing-terms#binaural-filtering)
When you make a **binaural recording**, you put one microphone into each ear of a dummy head, thereby recording from a first-person perspective. Remember that this means the perspective you are recording will be 'colored' by the dimensions of the dummy head and ears.  

Alternatively, you can pop a microphone in each of your own ears and record with your own head size and ear shape. But the same concept applies to this method – if you pass on your recording to someone else, they will be listening from the perspective of _your_ ears. It might be pretty different from their own ears, which could degrade the quality of the spatial experience.

Binaural recording is used most often for ASMR, for testing in audio technology, and for art and entertainment experiences.

### [Binaural Recording](../mixing-terms#binaural-recording)
When you hear any kind of ''spatial audio'' in your headphones, it is always a binaural mixdown, unless your headphones are over your ears and have multiple drivers (there are experimental versions of this but nothing of the sort is available for consumers, so we'll ignore experimental headsets for now). 

If your recording was not made *binaurally*, the second and third way in which the term binaural is used is for **filtering and rendering**. 

You could take a sound source such as a recording you took on your phone of your daughter playing violin, and bring it into a DAW. Then, you could apply some kind of binaural filter using a #plugin. 

Or you could use a different kind of spatial audio plugin and then export it as a binaural file (two-channels but from a first-person perspective), or a multichannel binaural mix. The number of channels you are able to play back depend on the system you are using. If you have a multichannel file that can't be played on your system, you will have zero spatial audio. The way to overcome this is to create a binaural mixdown – an intermediary step that takes your multichannel file, and accurately mixes it down to two channels. However, if you do this, pay attention, because you might lose the ability to have head-tracking.
 
These methods sound similar but are doing different things. If you slap on a binaural filter early on, you're stuck with it.

### [3DOF](../mixing-terms#3dof)
_3DOF stands for 3 Degrees of Freedom:_
 - _Rotating head left and right (shaking head as "no")_
 - _Rotating head up and down (shaking head as "yes")_
 - _Tilting head from left to right (tilting head so left ear approaches left shoulder or right ear approaches right shoulder)_
_Typically if you refer to a spatial mix as a 3DOF mix then you are implying it is only a headtracking or orientation only mix, instead of the mix being intended for head rotations as well as walking around._
##### Synonyms : 360-Mix, Orientational
##### Related Terms : [3DOF (sensor)](../technical-terms#3dof)

---

### [6DOF](../mixing-terms#6dof)
_6DOF stands for 6 degrees of Freedom:_
 - _Rotating head left and right (shaking head as "no")_
 - _Rotating head up and down (shaking head as "yes")_
 - _Tilting head from left to right (tilting head so left ear approaches left shoulder or right ear approaches right shoulder)_
 - _Walking forward or back_
 - _Strafing left or right (side-stepping to your left or right)_
 - _Climbing up or down (in level or floors)_

Typically this is referred to as [roomscale](../technical-terms#roomscale) or orientational & positional movements and rotations.
##### Synonyms : [Roomscale](../technical-terms#roomscale), Orientational & Positional
##### Related Terms : [6DOF (sensor)](../technical-terms#6dof)
