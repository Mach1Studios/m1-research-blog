## [Common Workflow Terms](../mixing-terms#workflow-terms)
---

### [Panning](../mixing-terms#panning)
_Refers to panning a source sound or track into a spatial soundfield multichannel configuration or format. It is completely synonymous with [Encode](../technical-terms#encode)_
##### Synonyms : [Pan](../mixing-terms#panning), [Encode](../technical-terms#encode), Input to Spatial Soundfield
##### Related Terms :

### [Monitoring](../mixing-terms#monitoring)
_Refers to the binaural downmix based on the current listening "orientation" as a method of monitoring or live listening to a spatial soundfield via stereo binuaralized headpones or speakers. It is completely synonymous with [Decode](../technical-terms#decode)_
##### Synonyms : [Monitor](../mixing-terms#monitoring), [Decode](../technical-terms#decode), [Listening](../mixing-terms#monitoring), Stereo Playback, [Binauralized](../mixing-terms#binaural)
##### Related Terms : [Binaural](../mixing-terms#binaural)

---

### [Divergence](../mixing-terms#diverge)
_Divergence describes the amount of concentration of a panned or encoded input sound source to a specific [azimuth](../technical-terms#azimuth) or [elevation](../technical-terms#elevation). For example the higher the diverge the less this signal will exist in the opposite direction, the lower the diverge the more the signal will exist in all directions (until eventually becoming mono during [monitoring](../mixing-terms#monitoring) or [decoding](../technical-terms#decode))._
_This is unique to a vector based spatial or multichannel audio system and is different from sperhical based audio systems [distance](../general-terms#distance) which is less about signal distribution within a soundfield._
##### Synonyms : Focus, Directional Isolation
##### Related Terms : [Distance](../general-terms#distance)

## [Processing Effect Terms](../mixing-terms#processing-terms)
---

### [HRTF](../mixing-terms#hrtf)
##### Synonyms : [Head Related Transfer Functions](../general-terms#hrtf)
##### Related Terms : 

---

### [Room Modeling](../mixing-terms#room-modeling)
_Room modeling is a catch all term for various [reverberance](../mixing-terms#reverb), delay and even filter digital signal processes (DSP) that can be applied to the audio content. This can be used as a tool to add more externalization preception ability to any audio content but comes at the cost of altering the signal to do so. This effect is highly dependent on the use case and how this is being utilized to be more effective than destructive._
##### Synonyms : [Reverb](../mixing-terms#reverb), [Reverberance](../mixing-terms#reverb)
##### Related Terms : [Externalization](../general-terms#externalization)

---

### [Binaural Filtering](../mixing-terms#binaural-filtering)

##### Synonyms : 
##### Related Terms : [Binaural Recording](../mixing-terms#binaural-recording)

## [Spatial Mix Dimensions](../mixing-terms#spatial-dimensions)
---

### [3DOF](../mixing-terms#3dof)
_3DOF stands for 3 Degrees of Freedom:_
 - _Rotating head left and right (shaking head as "no")_
 - _Rotating head up and down (shaking head as "yes")_
 - _Tilting head from left to right (tilting head so left ear approaches left shoulder or right ear approaches right shoulder)_
_Typically if you refer to a spatial mix as a 3DOF mix then you are implying it is only a headtracking or orientation only mix, instead of the mix being intended for head rotations as well as walking around._
##### Synonyms : 360-Mix, Orientational
##### Related Terms : [3DOF (sensor)](../technical-terms#3dof)

---

### [6DOF](../mixing-terms#6dof)
_6DOF stands for 6 degrees of Freedom:_
 - _Rotating head left and right (shaking head as "no")_
 - _Rotating head up and down (shaking head as "yes")_
 - _Tilting head from left to right (tilting head so left ear approaches left shoulder or right ear approaches right shoulder)_
 - _Walking forward or back_
 - _Strafing left or right (side-stepping to your left or right)_
 - _Climbing up or down (in level or floors)_

Typically this is referred to as [roomscale](../technical-terms#roomscale) or orientational & positional movements and rotations.
##### Synonyms : [Roomscale](../technical-terms#roomscale), Orientational & Positional
##### Related Terms : [6DOF (sensor)](../technical-terms#6dof)

### [Channel-Based](../mixing-terms#channel-based)

##### Synonyms : [Surround](../existing-formats#surround)
##### Related Terms : [Mach1 Spatial](../existing-formats#mach1-spatial), [Dolby Atmos](../existing-formats#dolby-atmos)
