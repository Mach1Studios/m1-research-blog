## [Spatial Audio: Common Issues](../technical-terms#commonissues)
---

### [Gimbal Lock](../technical-terms#gimbal-lock)
Gimbal lock is a loss of a degree of freedom when two axes rotate in parralel, the output rotation becomes one less degree of freedom.

To explain this more simply; two or more axes line up in a way so that the applied Euler rotation cannot distiguish which of the two axes are rotating because they yield the same results. 

_Example: If you add 90 pitch upward in degrees to an object, rotating yaw or roll would yield the same result._

### [Latency](../technical-terms#latency)
Describes when something has a latent or delayed reaction. Typically in spatial audio world we can describe headtracking or 3D rotations as being latent when you can percieve a time delay from your real world motion to the interacted virtual motion. This can be a very destructive issue for any hardware that has motion based sensors in them when applied to audio for spatial audio perception.

When discussing latency in the audio world in general it can refer to the actual audio signal itself having a perceived delay.

## [Additional Technologies](../technical-terms#tech)

### [IMU](../technical-terms#imu)
Stands for *I*nertial *M*otion *U*nit, a series of sensors usually within a silicon chip that can typically include any number of the following sensor types:
- Accelerometer
- Gyroscope
- Magnometer

Each of these sensor outputs can have typically 3 data outputs so the IMU typically includes a process called [Sensor Fusion](../technical-terms#sensor-fusion) to combine the datasets of all sensors into one dataset for orientation and/or position.
##### Synonyms : 
##### Related Terms : [Sensor Fusion](../technical-terms#sensor-fusion)

### [Sensor Fusion](../technical-terms#sensor-fusion)
Sensor Fusion is a a mathematics for combining multiple datasets relating to motion or force into one dataset for predicting orientation, [heading](../technical-terms#heading) and/or position. The output data can be collected into different types such as [Radians](../technical-terms#radians) or [Degrees](../technical-terms#degrees) or [Quaternion](../technical-terms#quat).

### [Realtime](../technical-terms#realtime)
_Refers to a process or effect that can be applied in realtime, usually during playback but in general any process that can be computed faster than actual time._

##### Synonyms : 
##### Related Terms : 

---

### [Runtime](../technical-terms#runtime)
_Refers to all processes that happen during the playback of the sound content._

`Spatial audio` processes that are limited to runtime processes have to compensate for what processing power is available on that device, this limitation means that these processes have to be able to run faster than realtime and can sometimes be limited in quality.

##### Synonyms : 
##### Related Terms : 

---

### [Render](../technical-terms#render)
_Refers to a process of pre-determining all intended processes and effects to an output file usually to be faithfully replayed or reused without change._ 

`Spatial audio` content that has been pre-rendered or rendered has the added benefit of using more time expensive and higher quality processing effects that might not normally be too expensive to be processed in realtime, especially from device to device.
